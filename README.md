## Part 4: 
**Observed Network**
- **Uneven Distribution:** The in-degree distribution is highly skewed.
- **Presence of Hubs:** Clear central figures exist, such as BONAVEN_5, who is significantly more popular than others.
- **Presence of Periphery:** There are also peripheral or nearly isolated figures with very low in-degrees (GREG_2).
- 
**Random Network**
- **Uniform Distribution:** The in-degree distribution is relatively uniform and centered around the mean.
- **Lack of Hubs:** There are no standout "stars"; popularity is evenly distributed.
- **Lack of Isolates:** Every node receives a similar number of connections.

**In what ways are the networks similar?**
The networks are similar in their basic properties: they have the same number of nodes(18 monks) and a similar overall density(total number of "likes"). This results in a nearly identical average in-degree across both networks.

**In what ways are they different?**
The primary difference lies in the structure of the degree distribution. The observed network has a skewed distribution characteristic of real-world social systems, with a few highly connected hubs. The random network has a uniform distribution, which is a direct result of a random connection process where every node has an equal probability of receiving a link.

**What patterns are missing from the random model?**
The random model lacks key patterns of real social structures, most notably preferential attachment and community structure. It cannot replicate the "rich get richer" phenomenon where popular individuals attract more connections, nor can it form the tightly-knit clusters or "cliques" that emerge organically in human societies.
